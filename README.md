# Short Term Memory Illusion Test
## Introduction
According to the research article ["Seeing Æ†, remembering C: Illusions in short-
term memory" by Marte Otten, Anil K.Seth and Yair Pinto](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283257), there are some experiments that lend support to a neuroscientific view that our expectations can shape memory traces. The following test tries to emulate the experiment cited in the article, which was originally programmed with [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [The Psychophysics Toolbox](https://github.com/Psychtoolbox-3/Psychtoolbox-3).
